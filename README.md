BruceCrane_20Percent
====================

My twenty percent repository.

I really liked that engarde project. So much in fact, I think I'll make my project an extension of that.


So first thing I want to do:

  - smarter EnGarde.
  - get rid of all the bugs.
  - Improve the value setting heuristic (Machine Learning?)
  - buffer: a way to hold onto the data, so that each time a choice is made the machine does not have to
    reconsider the possibility tree.
  - Rematch with Kaplelibot.
